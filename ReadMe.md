# Hai hai ! :3
welcome to my jda framework thing!

This was a thing made for JDA v5 because I wanted to make a small discord bot, contributions are welcome!

Before using you should probably have a base knowledge of [jda](https://jda.wiki/introduction/jda/).

Attribution isn't required (as implied by the mit license) but it would be cool :3

### Features

this framework includes stuff like
- easy command registration
- command aliases
- slash commands by default
- terminal commands for uptime and shutdowns (expandable)
- sample commands

### Key parts

the most important stuff in this codebase are the:
- CommandBase - the class you extend to make a new command
- Main - where you set up jda and initialize commands
- CommandListener - the thing that parses and interprets events

### Thank you!
